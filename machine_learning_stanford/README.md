# Machine Learning Programming Exercises

These are the Machine Learning Programming Excercises that are provided as part of Coursera's Machine Learning Specialization offered by Stanford University and taught by Professor Andrew Ng. In the course the programming language used is Octave, here I am implementing them using Google Tensorflow framework.

This is being expanded to include implementation of other problems.
 - Fraud detection
 - Anomaly detection
