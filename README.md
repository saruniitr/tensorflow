# Tensorflow Programming Exercises
This repository holds various Machine Learning programming exercises that are implemented using Google Tensorflow framework.

## Tensorflow
TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. More on this at [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)


* general - Tensorflow implementation of some generic problems such as Fibonacci series, Image Convolution etc.

* machine_learning_stanford - Tensorflow implementation of programming exercises that are implemented as part of Machine Learning Specialization course.

Some additional problems include,
<br>
Fraud Detection - Analysis of real untagged Credit card transaction data and classify whether a transaction is fradulent or valid using Logistic Regression

Anomaly Detection - Analysis of Network latency and throughput data (test data) and identify anomalies behaviour.
