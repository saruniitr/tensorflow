# Tensorflow Programming Exercises
This repository holds various Machine Learning programming exercises that are implemented using Google Tensorflow framework.

## Tensorflow
TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them.
